<p>Direct Debits provide you with peace of mind as it automates the payment process and is easy to set up. You may download, complete and email us the form below; alternatively, you may call our Business Support Team at <a class="link">020 7870 4940</a>.</p>

<p>Once your Direct Debit is established, you will receive a monthly invoice 10 days in advance to notify you of the amount to be withdrawn from your account.</p>

<p>In the event that you are Non-Half-Hourly (NHH) and do not have a SMART meter, sending us regular meter readings will help ensure accuracy.</p>
