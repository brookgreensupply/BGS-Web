<p>For Non-Half Hourly (NHH) and non-Smart meter customers, keeping track and submitting your business energy consumption is important so as to avoid additional costs that may be associated to estimated bills.</p>

<p>Simply take a meter reading, five days before or after the last day of your billing month period. Submit your reading by contacting our Business Support Team.</p>

<p>When submitting your meter reading please have your Brook Green Supply Account Number, MPAN/MPRN, Meter ID and the supply address – along with your meter reading(s). All of this information can be found on your monthly invoices.</p>
