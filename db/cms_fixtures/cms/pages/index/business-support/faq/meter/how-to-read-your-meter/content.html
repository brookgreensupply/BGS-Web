<h3>Most UK businesses now have either half-hourly or smart meters and in such a case this section will not be relevant as such meters submit their data to the supplier, automatically. In the event that your site does not have a half-hourly or smart meter, this section will explain how you should perform a reading and submit this to your supplier.</h3>

<h3>Submit your meter reading</h3>
<p>Your meter records the amount of gas and electricity your business has consumed. Taking regular meter readings is recommended as it allows for better energy management and more accurate bills.</p>
<p>Reading your electricity and gas meter can be tricky, so below we have outlined some tips.</p>

<h3>A guide to reading your electricity meter</h3>
<p>Your electricity meter is used to record how much electricity you’ve used and is usually measured in terms of kWh or kilowatt-hours (this is the number of units of energy you use in one hour).</p>
<p>There are two types of non-smart electricity meters: dial and digital.</p>

<h3>Reading a dial meter</h3>
<p>A typical dial meter comprises of six dials, these read from left to right. The sixth and final dial may be ignored. The dials move in opposite directions, where the first meter will read clockwise, the second anticlockwise and so on.<br />
  If the pointer is between two numbers, always read the lower number. For example, if the pointer falls between 3 and 4, you would read 3, as it is the lower number. <br />
  If the pointer falls between 9 and 0, you would read 9 always.<br />
  If the pointer falls exactly on a number, record the number it directly falls on.</p>

<p>If we look at the above dial Meter and read it from left to right as previously mentioned, we see the dial reading is <span style="font-weight: bold;">14705</span> and we ignore the sixth, red dial.</p>

<h3>Reading a digital meter</h3>
<p>With a digital meter, there are a possibility of two meter types: LCD meters or mechanical meters.</p>

<h3>LCD digital meter</h3>
<p>With an LCD meter, simply read the number as it appears from left to right, ignoring the number after the decimal point.</p>

<p>If we look at the above LCD meter and read it from left to right, the meter reading is <span style="font-weight: bold;">51029</span> and we ignore the sixth figure, after the decimal point.</p>

<h3>Mechanical digital meter</h3>
<p>Finally, a mechanical meter has a row of six numbered wheels that read from left to right – <span style="font-weight: bold;">40217</span> below. The sixth and final figure is ignored.</p>

<h3>Multi-rate meters</h3>
<p>Each meter can have up to three rates. There are one rate meters, known as ‘Standard’, two rate meters, known as ‘Economy 7’ and three rate meters known as ‘Economy 10,’ or ‘Evening, Weekend and Night Meter.’<br />
In the case of either a two rate or three rate meter, one meter reading will refer to the ‘normal’ or ‘day rate’ and the other(s) will refer to the ‘evening’ or ‘weekend’ rate. Each meter reading is to be recorded and submitted separately.</p>

<h3>A guide to reading your gas meter</h3>
<p>Gas meters use dissimilar units of measure to electricity meters. Your supplier will convert the gas units to kWh for billing purposes.<br>
 All gas meters display either a four or five-digit number, indicating the number of gas units you have consumed.</p>

<h3>Reading a digital meter</h3>
<p>Similar to electricity meters, there are two different types of digital gas meters: metric meters or imperial meters.</p>

<h3>Digital metric meter</h3>
<p>Digital metric meters’ measure gas in m3 (cubic meters). Similar to an LCD digital electricity meter, the numbers are read and recorded from left to right, ignoring the number after the decimal point.</p>

<h3>Digital imperial meter</h3>
<p>Digital imperial meters’ measure gas in ft3 (cubic feet). This meter type will usually display four numbers. The digital imperial meter is similar to a mechanical meter, the numbers are read from left to right again and the number in red is ignored.</p>

<h3>Smart Meters and Half Hourly Meters</h3>
<p>Both half hourly meters and smart meters communicate with your energy supplier, relaying your meter readings to the supplier. Therefore, there is no need to take any meter readings or for your supplier to estimate your bill. For more information on smart metering please contact our Business Support Team.</p>

<h3>How to Submit your Meter Reading</h3>
  <p>To submit your meter reading, please have your customer account details at hand, with your meter readings and call our Business Support Team on <a class="link">020 7870 4940</a> or email us at <a class="link" href="mailto:support@brookgreensupply.com">support@brookgreensupply.com</a></p>
