<h3 class="summary">If you have a gas supply over a certain size you must provide us with up to date emergency contact details so we can contact you in case of an emergency.</h3>
<p>Emergency contact details are required for Gas only where an individual sites consumption is over 732,000 kWh (25,000 therms) per annum. These contact details are used in the event of an emergency only.</p>
<p>We require details of three separate representatives if the sites are not manned 24 hours. The telephone numbers need to be different for each of the three contacts provided. You must also provide a fax number â€“ a single fax number suffice for all three representatives listed on the form.</p>
<p>If the sites are manned 24 hours a single contact is acceptable; however, if any sites are over 1,464,000 kWh (50,000 therms) a fax number should also be provided whether they are 24 hour contacts or not.</p>
