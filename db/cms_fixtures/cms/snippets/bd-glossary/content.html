  <dt>ETL / ETPL:</dt>
<dd>The Energy Technology Product List (ETPL) is a government-managed list of energy-efficient plan and machinery, such as boilers, electric motors and refrigeration that qualify for full tax relief. It is part of the Enhanced Capital Allowance (ECA) tax scheme for businesses to encourage energy savings. For a product to be on the ETL, it must meet specific energy-saving or energy-efficient criteria. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) annually reviews the technologies and products that qualify for inclusion. The ETL is managed on behalf of DECC by the Carbon Trust.</dd>
  <dt>AMR:</dt>
<dd>Automated Meter Reading.</dd>
<dt>Half Hourly:</dt>
<dd>Half-Hourly metering is a class of meter that is used by Industry and Commercial (I&amp;C) businesses. Unlike NHH meters, HH meters automatically provide meter reading every half-hour allowing for a more accurate read of the amount consumed and the time of consumption. This data flow allows for better capacity and consumption management. See P272 programme for information regarding the roll-out of HH meters throughout class 5-8.</dd>
<dt>BEIS:</dt>
<dd>The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), previously known as the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change, works to make sure the UK has secure, clean, affordable energy supplies and promote international action to mitigate climate change. - visit the BEIS.</dd>

For additional information visit <a class="link" href="www.elexon.co.uk">Elexon</a></dd>
<dt>kWh:</dt>
<dd>Kilowatt hour is 1,000 watts and is typically the unit of measure on your bill.</dd>
<dt>BSUoS:</dt>
<dd>Balancing Service Use of System pays for the balancing of power across the grid – in other words, making sure that just the right amount of supply is provided to meet the demand. Good balancing avoids blackouts and wastage.</dd>
<dt>LDZ:</dt>
<dd>Local Distribution Zone. For gas, there are thirteen LDZ grouped across five Gas Distribution Networks across the UK. The National Grid has divided the UK into LDZs for the purpose of calculating shippers’ charges for transporting gas within the National Transmission System (NTS). Southern Gas Network Ltd SC - Scotland Northern Gas Network Ltd NO - Northern NE - North East National Grid Gas NWT - North West WMD - West Midlands EM - East Midlands EA - East Anglia NT - North Thames Wales &amp; West Utilities WN - Wales North WS - Wales South SW - South Wales Southern Gas Network Ltd SO - Southern SE - South East Gas is delivered to the local distribution zones via the NTS, which then supply the end-user. This is achieved via a less pressurised system than the NTS.</dd>
<dt>CCA:</dt>
<dd>Climate Change Agreement are voluntary agreements made by UK industry and the environmental agency to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The CCA allow energy intensive business users to receive a 65 per cent discount from the Climate Change Levy (CCL), in return for meeting energy efficiency or carbon saving targets. The CCL is a tax on the use of energy in industry, commerce and the public sector. The aim of the levy is to encourage users to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</dd>
<dt>MWh:</dt>
<dd>1 MWh is 1,000 kilowatts and 1,000,000 watts and is used to emphasise when electricity is being measured. MWt is used when heat (“thermal”) is being measured.</dd>
<dt>CCC:</dt>
<dd>Climate Change Convention.</dd>
<dt>NGC:</dt>
<dd>National Grid Company is the Transmission Operator and has a licence obligation to manage the Transmission System.</dd>
<dt>CCL:</dt>
<dd>Climate Change Levy covers the costs of developing renewable energy sources to offset high levels of consumption. The tax charged in the UK on the commercial and industrial businesses that consume more than 33kWh per day of electricity or 145kWh per day of gas. If a customer owns a single site with multiple meter points, the total is an aggregate. A lower CCL rate may apply if the site has the relevant CCL certificate issues by HMRC. Other rates may apply under specific conditions as listed by the HMRC.</dd>
<dt>Non-Half Hourly (NHH):</dt>
<dd>Non-half hourly metering is a class of meter that is primarily used for domestic and micro businesses. The NHH meter lacks precision in that it provides consumption data but no information regarding when the electricity was consumed. These are slowly being phases out - see P272.</dd>
<dt>CHP electricity:</dt>
<dd>Combined heat and power that is exempt from CCL under Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2000.</dd>

<dd>Carbon Reduction Commitment. The CRC Energy Efficiency scheme is a mandatory scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions in large public and private sector organisations.</dd>
<dt>Renewable Obligation (RO):</dt>
<dd>Renewable Obligation charge was designed to encourage large scale renewable electricity generation and help the UK government meet its 2020 target of having 15% of energy generated by renewable sources. Deemed contract A deemed contract is normally in place when any type of customer moves into new premises and starts to consume gas, electricity, or both, without agreeing a contract with a supplier. A deemed contract may also exist where an existing contract comes to an end but the customer continues to consume energy. For further information, please refer to our T&amp;Cs.</dd>

<dt>DNO:</dt>
<dd>Distribution Network Operator are responsible for maintaining the power lines that connect your business. They own and operate the distribution network of towers and cables that bring electricity from our national transmission network to homes and businesses. Should you suffer power cuts, you should contact your DNO, which is listed on your bill and on our website at www.brookgreensupply.com/FAQ. Visit the DNO website.</dd>
<dt>Shipper:</dt>
<dd>A company that buys and owns gas from producers and transports it along a pipeline system (transmission and distribution network). Shippers need to be registered with the local regulatory body. In UK gas market terms, a shipper is a company that buys gas ‘at the beach’ and pays the National Grid to transport the gas along the pipeline system.</dd>

<dt>DUoS:</dt>
<dd>Distribution Use of System, covers the cost of distributing electricity from the National Grid transmission lines to the point of consumption.

<dt>ECA:</dt>
<dd>Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme means that a business can invest in energy-saving plant or machinery that might otherwise be too expensive. The first year allowances let businesses set 100% of the cost of the assets against taxable profits in a single tax year. This means the company can write off the cost of the new plant or machinery against the business’s taxable profits in the financial year the purchase was made.
