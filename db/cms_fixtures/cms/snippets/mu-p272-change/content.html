<p>P272, an industry wide change mandating Half-Hourly (HH) settlement for all profile class 5-8 meters. As of 1 April 2017, all electricity consumers with profile class 5-8 will need to have their meters updated to allow for HH reads.<br/>
Most small businesses are affected by this change and will need to reconfigure their meter before the deadline set by Ofgem. The process can take up to 45 days and as a consumer with a profile class 5-8 meter, you should contact your supplier as soon as possible.</p>
